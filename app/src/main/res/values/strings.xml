    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Odalys Martinez-Villa.
        \n\n I am 19 years old and I attend FGCU and I am majoring in Software Engineering.
        \n\n I was born at the hospital in Fort Myers Florida and I have lived my whole life
        at Labelle, Florida. I live with both my parents and I have a younger brother who is 17 and
        still attending high school. I have 4 cats, and one wild cat that just chills at my house
        and eats along with my other cats.
        \n\n During my free time I like to hang out with my friends either by going shopping,
        eating, or having bonfires at my house.
        \n\n I have recently developed a hobby of couponing and I am a little obsessed.
        I think that it is fun trying to pay the lowest total possible and my favorite stores
        to coupon is at Walgreens, Dollar General, and Family Dollar. I will never
        pay full price again for items that I can get free or nearly free.
        \n\n Some personal facts about me is that my favorite color is orange, I love and embrace
        my Mexican culture, especially music. I love to watch Riverdale and Grey\'s Anatomy
        and I enjoy dancing and spending time with my family.
        \n\n Thanks for viewing this little app. Enjoy!
